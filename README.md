# Stat 172 Final Project - Redlining
For this final project, I'll be using the redlining dataset from fivethirtyeight, to analyze if combating redlining is possible and how to reduce redlining for my hypothetical client.

I cleaned the dataset, and then moved on to making visualizations. I also made a random forest, used logistic regression, and various feature engineering tactics.
